Building this portfolio involved:

1. Designing the Layout: Deciding on the sections, their order, and how content should be grouped.
2. Structuring with HTML: Writing the semantic markup for all the content.
3. Styling with CSS: Making it visually appealing, aligning elements, adding colors, fonts, and making it responsive.
4. Adding Interactivity with JavaScript: Implementing features like the hamburger menu and scroll animations.
